If you are a fan of the classic turn-based strategy game Civilization II, you might be wondering how to play it on your modern Windows 10 PC. The original game was released in 1996 and was followed by an expansion pack called Civilization II: Conflicts in Civilization in 1997.

Unfortunately, Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition is not compatible with Windows 10 out of the box. The game was designed for Windows 95/98 and requires a 16-bit installer that does not work on 64-bit systems. Moreover, the game has issues with screen resolution, sound, and graphics on newer machines. However, there is a way to make it work with some tweaks and patches.
  
In this article, we will show you how to download and play Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition on Windows 10 using a combination of official patches, fan-made fixes, and emulation software. Follow these steps to enjoy this classic game on your modern PC:
