# Outlines of Chemical Technology by Charles E. Dryden: A Review
 
Outlines of Chemical Technology is a classic textbook on chemical engineering written by Charles E. Dryden and first published in 1954. The book covers various aspects of chemical technology, such as raw materials, processes, products, and economics. The book is divided into four parts: Part I deals with the general principles of chemical engineering, such as unit operations, thermodynamics, kinetics, and catalysis. Part II covers the major industries based on organic chemistry, such as petroleum, petrochemicals, synthetic fibers, plastics, rubber, and pharmaceuticals. Part III focuses on the industries based on inorganic chemistry, such as fertilizers, cement, glass, ceramics, metals, and electrochemicals. Part IV discusses some special topics, such as nuclear energy, food processing, pulp and paper, and environmental engineering.

The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples, diagrams, tables, and references. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of chemical engineering, as well as practicing engineers and researchers. The book has been revised and updated several times by different editors, such as M. Gopala Rao and Marshall Sittig. The latest edition was published in 1973 by Affiliated East-West Press.
 
Outlines of Chemical Technology is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about the fundamentals and applications of chemical technology. The book is available in print and digital formats from various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. However, some of the information may be outdated or inaccurate due to the rapid changes in the field of chemical technology. Therefore, readers are advised to consult more recent and reliable sources for updated information.

However, chemical technology is not a static field. It is constantly evolving and adapting to new challenges and opportunities. In this section, we will briefly review some of the emerging trends and technologies that are shaping the future of chemical technology.
 
## Technology Trends in Chemical Industry
 
According to SAP[^4^], there are five technology trends that are fostering change and innovation in the chemical industry:
 
- **Hyper-connectivity.** Through digital transformation, we are finding that connections between individuals and machines are rising at an alarming rate. This enables new business models, such as digital platforms, smart services, and data-driven solutions.
- **Supercomputing.** Supercomputing through the use of SAP HANA eliminates the separation of transactions and analytics. This allows real-time insights and faster decision making for chemical companies.
- **Cloud Computing.** Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency for chemical companies. It also enables collaboration and innovation across the value chain.
- **Smarter World.** The world is becoming smarter with the proliferation of sensors, devices, and networks. This creates opportunities for chemical companies to leverage the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to optimize their operations, products, and services.
- **Cybersecurity.** With the increasing digitalization and connectivity of the chemical industry, cybersecurity becomes a critical issue. Chemical companies need to protect their data, assets, and reputation from cyberattacks and comply with regulatory standards.

## Emerging Chemistry Technologies for a Better World
 
Nature Chemistry has identified ten emerging chemistry technologies that have the potential to advance our society and improve our quality of life. These are:

- **Sustainable production of ammonia.** Ammonia is a key feedstock for fertilizers and other chemicals, but its conventional production from natural gas is energy-intensive and emits large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>. New methods based on renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, or using electrochemical or biological catalysts, aim to produce ammonia in a more sustainable way.
- **RNA vaccines.** RNA vaccines are a new type of vaccines that use messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules to instruct cells to produce antigens that trigger an immune response. RNA vaccines have been successfully developed and deployed against COVID-19, demonstrating their efficacy, safety, and speed of development. RNA vaccines could also be used to prevent or treat other diseases, such as cancer or influenza.
- **Metalâorganic frameworks (MOFs).** MOFs are porous materials composed of metal ions or clusters connected by organic linkers. MOFs have a large surface area and tunable properties, making them suitable for various applications, such as gas storage, separation, catalysis, sensing, drug delivery, and energy conversion.
- **Battery recycling.** Batteries are essential for powering electric vehicles and storing renewable energy, but they also pose environmental and social challenges due to their limited lifespan, scarce raw materials, and hazardous components. Battery recycling aims to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries and reuse them for new batteries or other purposes.
- **Biomimetic materials.** Biomimetic materials are synthetic materials that mimic the structure or function of natural materials or systems. Biomimetic materials can offer superior performance, functionality, or sustainability compared to conventional materials. Examples include self-healing materials inspired by biological tissues, superhydrophobic materials inspired by lotus leaves, and adhesive materials inspired by geckos or mussels.
